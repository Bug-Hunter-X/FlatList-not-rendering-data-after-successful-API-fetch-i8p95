# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data even after a successful API call. The bug is present in `bug.js`, and the solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The application fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint.  The fetch call is successful and the data is logged to the console, however, the FlatList remains empty.  This is likely due to incorrect usage of the FlatList component, state management, or data handling.

## Solution

The solution addresses the issue by ensuring that the data is correctly formatted and that the FlatList is properly configured to render the data.  This includes checking data types, handling potential errors and ensuring the `keyExtractor` is correctly used.
